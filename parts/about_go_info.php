    Go is a procedural programming language. It was developed in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, 
    and Ken Thompson at Google but launched in 2009 as an open-source programming language. Programs are assembled

<ul>
    <li>C and other oher languages have developed in a era when computers had very low capacity(RAM/Processor) so these languages sacrificed couple of aspects those could boost compile time.</li>
    <li>Threading is introduced in other languages later after creation so these languages are lacking/less compatability towards threading.</li>
    <li>Simplicity in compiled languages.</li>
    <li>Dependency management in new style(Remember how we managed dependancies in C/C++).</li>
    <li>Creation of executable at platform free.</li>
</ul>
